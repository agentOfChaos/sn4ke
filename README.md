sn4ke v 1.2 by  agentOfChaos  informaniac99  AT gmail DOT com

This is a small snake clone, running on the linux terminal, with ncurses and unicode graphics.
I've written it for fun, entirely in C.
Usage instructions are provided by the program, with the --help options.
I'm providing the original codeblocks project file, as well as a Makefile generared with cbp2make.

Quick start: $ make release

It's designed for the linux environment, but I don't exclude future ports.
Enjoy!
