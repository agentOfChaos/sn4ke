sn4ke v 1.2 by  agentOfChaos  informaniac99&lt;AT&gt;gmail&lt;DOT&gt;com<br>

This is a small snake clone, running on the linux terminal, with ncurses and unicode graphics.
I've written it for fun, entirely in C.<br>
Usage instructions are provided by the program, with the --help options.<br>
I'm providing the original codeblocks project file, as well as a Makefile generared with cbp2make.<br>

Quick start:<br>
$ make release<br>

It's designed for the linux environment, but I don't exclude future ports.<br>
Enjoy!
